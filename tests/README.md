# NexaFi Testing Suite

This directory (`NexaFi/tests`) houses the comprehensive testing suite for the NexaFi project. It is designed to ensure the reliability, functionality, performance, and security of all components of the NexaFi application, from individual units to the entire integrated system. A robust testing strategy is crucial for maintaining high code quality, preventing regressions, and delivering a stable and secure financial platform.

## Test Categories

The testing suite is organized into several distinct categories, each serving a specific purpose in validating the application:

- **End-to-End (E2E) Tests**: These tests simulate real user scenarios to verify that the entire application flow works as expected, from the user interface down to the backend services. They ensure that different parts of the system integrate correctly and that critical user journeys are seamless.
- **Frontend Tests**: Focused on the user interface and client-side logic, these tests ensure that the web and mobile applications behave correctly, display information accurately, and respond to user interactions as designed.
- **Integration Tests**: These tests verify the interactions between different modules or services within the NexaFi ecosystem. They ensure that components communicate correctly and that data flows smoothly across service boundaries.
- **Performance Tests**: Designed to assess the system's responsiveness, stability, and scalability under various load conditions. These tests help identify bottlenecks and ensure the application can handle expected user traffic.
- **Security Tests**: These tests are critical for identifying vulnerabilities and ensuring that the application is protected against common security threats. They validate authentication, authorization, data privacy, and other security mechanisms.
- **Unit Tests**: The most granular level of testing, unit tests focus on individual functions, methods, or classes in isolation. They ensure that each small piece of code works correctly according to its specifications.

## Detailed Test Descriptions

### End-to-End (E2E) Tests

E2E tests in NexaFi are designed to validate the entire application flow from a user's perspective. They interact with the application through its user interface, simulating real user actions and verifying the system's responses. These tests are crucial for catching issues that might arise from the integration of various components.

- **`mobile_e2e.test.js`**: This file contains conceptual E2E tests for the mobile application. While Playwright is primarily for web browsers, these tests outline the scenarios that would be covered in a dedicated mobile E2E testing environment (e.g., using Appium or Detox). They cover user login, registration, navigation to various modules (Accounting, Payments, AI Insights, Settings), logout, and conceptual tests for network resilience, push notifications, deep linking, biometric authentication, performance, and accessibility.

  > "Conceptual: Initializing mobile app and logging in." [1]

- **`web_e2e.test.js`**: This file contains E2E tests for the web application, implemented using Playwright. These tests simulate user interactions like logging in, navigating to different modules (Payments, AI Insights, Accounting), and verifying the displayed content. They ensure that critical user journeys on the web platform function correctly.

  > "User can navigate to Payments module" [2]

### Frontend Tests

Frontend tests focus on the client-side logic and user interface components of both the web and mobile applications.

- **Unit Tests (Mobile)**: Located in `frontend/unit/mobile/`, these tests cover individual components and functionalities of the mobile application. Examples include `test_App.test.jsx`, `test_MobileAuthPage.test.jsx`, and `test_mobileApi.test.jsx`, which likely test the main application component, the mobile authentication page, and the mobile API integration layer, respectively.

- **Unit Tests (Web)**: Located in `frontend/unit/web/`, these tests cover individual components and functionalities of the web application. Examples include `test_AccountingModule.test.jsx`, `test_AuthPage.test.jsx`, `test_App.test.jsx`, and `test_api.test.jsx`, which likely test the accounting module, the web authentication page, the main web application component, and the web API integration layer, respectively.

### Integration Tests

Integration tests verify the interactions between different services and modules within the NexaFi backend. Each subdirectory corresponds to a specific service.

- **AI Service (`ai_service/`)**: Contains `test_ai_routes.py`, which likely tests the API endpoints and routing for the AI service.
- **Analytics Service (`analytics_service/`)**: Includes `test_analytics_models.py` (testing data models) and `test_analytics_routes.py` (testing API routes) for the analytics service.
- **API Gateway (`api_gateway/`)**: Contains `test_api_gateway_routes.py`, focusing on the routing and proxying functionalities of the API Gateway.
- **Credit Service (`credit_service/`)**: Includes `test_credit_models.py` and `test_credit_routes.py`, testing the data models and API routes for the credit scoring service.
- **Document Service (`document_service/`)**: Contains `test_document_models.py` and `test_document_routes.py`, verifying the data models and API routes for document processing.

### Performance Tests

Performance tests are crucial for ensuring the application's scalability and responsiveness under load.

- **`locustfile.py`**: This file is used with Locust, an open-source load testing tool. It defines user behavior and tasks to simulate a large number of concurrent users interacting with the NexaFi application. This helps in identifying performance bottlenecks and ensuring the system can handle anticipated traffic.

### Security Tests

Security tests are vital for protecting the application and user data from malicious attacks.

- **`test_security.py`**: This file likely contains tests designed to identify common security vulnerabilities, such as injection flaws, broken authentication, sensitive data exposure, and other OWASP Top 10 risks. It ensures that the application's security measures are effective.

### Unit Tests (Shared)

These unit tests cover shared utilities and configurations used across different parts of the NexaFi project.

- **Config (`unit/shared/config/`)**: Contains `test_infrastructure.py`, which likely tests the configuration settings related to the project's infrastructure.
- **Utils (`unit/shared/utils/`)**: Includes tests for various utility functions:
  - `test_cache.py`: Tests caching mechanisms.
  - `test_circuit_breaker.py`: Tests the circuit breaker pattern implementation for fault tolerance.
  - `test_logging.py`: Tests the logging functionalities.
  - `test_message_queue.py`: Tests the message queue integration and functionalities.

## How to Run Tests (Conceptual)

To run the tests, you would typically navigate to the root of the NexaFi repository and execute commands specific to each testing framework or category. While the exact commands depend on the project's build system and test runners, here's a conceptual overview:

- **For JavaScript/Frontend Tests (E2E, Frontend Unit)**: These tests are likely run using `npm` or `yarn` commands, leveraging frameworks like Playwright (for E2E) and potentially Jest or React Testing Library (for frontend unit tests).

  ```bash
  # Example: Run all E2E tests
  npm test -- e2e

  # Example: Run all frontend unit tests
  npm test -- frontend/unit
  ```

- **For Python Tests (Integration, Performance, Security, Shared Unit)**: These tests are likely executed using `pytest` or similar Python testing frameworks.

  ```bash
  # Example: Run all integration tests
  pytest tests/integration

  # Example: Run performance tests with Locust
  locust -f tests/performance/locustfile.py

  # Example: Run security tests
  pytest tests/security

  # Example: Run shared unit tests
  pytest tests/unit/shared
  ```

Before running tests, ensure all necessary dependencies are installed for each respective environment (Node.js for frontend, Python for backend).

## Conclusion

The NexaFi testing suite is a critical component of the development lifecycle, ensuring the delivery of a high-quality, reliable, and secure financial application. By categorizing tests into E2E, frontend, integration, performance, security, and unit tests, the project maintains a comprehensive approach to quality assurance, covering all layers of the application from user interaction to backend services and infrastructure.
