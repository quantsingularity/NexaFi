| **Node.js** | 18+                                                                            |
| **pnpm**    | Package manager for frontend dependencies.                                     |
| **Docker**  | Docker Engine and Docker Compose for running the microservices infrastructure. |

### Quick Start

The `setup.sh` script automates the installation of system dependencies (Docker) and project dependencies (Python, Node.js).

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/quantsingularity/NexaFi.git
cd NexaFi

# Run the setup script
# This script will install Docker, Python dependencies, and frontend dependencies
./scripts/setup.sh

# Start the entire application using Docker Compose
# This will launch all backend microservices and the database infrastructure
docker-compose -f backend/infrastructure/docker-compose.yml up -d

# Run the web frontend (in a separate terminal)
cd web-frontend
pnpm start
```

### Manual Setup (Backend)

1.  **Install Python Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    for service_dir in backend/*/; do
      if [ -f "${service_dir}requirements.txt" ]; then
        echo "Installing dependencies for ${service_dir}..."
        cd "${service_dir}"
        python3 -m venv venv
        source venv/bin/activate
        pip install -r requirements.txt
        deactivate
        cd ../..
      fi
    done
    ```
2.  **Start Infrastructure:**
    ```bash
    cd backend/infrastructure
    ./start-infrastructure.sh
    # Or using Docker Compose:
    docker-compose up -d
    ```

### Manual Setup (Frontend)

1.  **Install pnpm:**
    ```bash
    npm install -g pnpm
    ```
2.  **Install Dependencies and Run:**
    ```bash
    cd web-frontend
    pnpm install
    pnpm run dev
    ```
