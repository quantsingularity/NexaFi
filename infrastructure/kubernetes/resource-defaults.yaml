# Resource Request/Limit Defaults
# Apply these patterns to all Deployments/StatefulSets

# Standard resource configurations:
#
# Small services (APIs, microservices):
#   requests:
#     memory: "128Mi"
#     cpu: "100m"
#   limits:
#     memory: "256Mi"
#     cpu: "200m"
#
# Medium services (databases, caches):
#   requests:
#     memory: "512Mi"
#     cpu: "250m"
#   limits:
#     memory: "1Gi"
#     cpu: "500m"
#
# Large services (ML, analytics):
#   requests:
#     memory: "2Gi"
#     cpu: "1000m"
#   limits:
#     memory: "4Gi"
#     cpu: "2000m"
